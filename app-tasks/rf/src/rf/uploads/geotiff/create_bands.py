# TODO: This module as it currently stands is specific to the UltraCam Falcon, which is just one of
# several imaging systems used by manned and unmanned aerial imagery providers, so this doesn't
# currently provide a generalized import solution for images from many different imaging systems.
# When we have more data from a wider selection of imaging systems, this should be refactored. For
# example, we might make submodules within the geotiff module that are specific to handling GeoTIFFs
# generated by different imaging systems.

# I am making some big assumptions based on the limited knowledge we have of the UltraCam Falcon; it
# includes R, G, B, and NIR bands.  I'm assuming that the RGB bands have similar absorption
# characteristics to those in the absorption graph here, and further I'm eyeballing the graph to try
# to select wavelength cutoffs that cover something like >75% of the area under each absorption
# curve:
# http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS02/robotik/Vorlesungen/Vorlesung2/ComputerVision-2.pdf
# I'm assuming that the NIR band has the same bandwidth as the average width of the
# RGB bands. I'm assuming than the panchromatic band has a width equal to the
# sum of the other four bands (RGB + NIR).
