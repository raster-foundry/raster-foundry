/**
  * Interface for a type class that may sort a query by a string representation for a field.
  * In case that a subclass of this interface does not know how to sort the query by the requested field,
  * the query should be returned unchanged. This requirement allows effects of multiple instances of [[QuerySort]]
  * to be composed through function composition on a query object.
  *
  * Subclasses of this interface are expected to request an addition type argument D and a function that maps
  * E to D. Constraints on D allows concrete fields to be invoked. Presence of a mapping E => D allows the
  * use of this interface on queries composed from table, as happens in case of joins.
  *
  * @tparam E Lifted representation of query fields
