# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)



## Installing

* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

```
