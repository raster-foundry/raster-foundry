  - title: Introduction
    level: 1
    content: |
      The Raster Foundry API allows developers to find, view, and analyze geospatial data in Raster Foundry. As the name implies, it's especially useful for working with large raster datasets like satellite imagery.

      Raster Foundry is built with an openly licensed, open source code base. If you'd like to peek under the hood, make a request, or become a contributor, <a href="https://github.com/raster-foundry/raster-foundry/issues" target="_blank">find us on Github</a>.
  - title: Authentication
    level: 2
    content: |
      Our API identifies applications and users with <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</a>. Refresh tokens can be created in your Raster Foundry account and used to generate example requests signed with valid session tokens <a href="https://help.rasterfoundry.com/developer-resources/generating-a-refresh-token-in-order-to-use-the-api" target="_blank">(detailed instructions are available here)</a>.

x-resources:
  - name: Projects
    description: |
      Projects are user-defined collections of scenes and are the fundamental unit that tools act on.
    further-description:
      - title: Project permissions
        content: |
          Projects are currently private to the user that created them and cannot be discovered by other Raster Foundry users. However, projects can be shared publicly as a tiled web map with a direct link.
          Project permissions will eventually expand to include making projects discoverable to all users or just users within an organization.
  - name: Scenes
    description: |
      Scenes are single or multi-image rasters where every image within the scene shares the same metadata characteristics and are always associated with a datasource. This simplest example of a scene is a single-band image like a land classification raster. The most complex example is a multi-image scene made up of multi-band images, like a pre-tiled aerial image where each tile is one piece of a larger coherent scene.
    further-description:
      - title: Scene permissions
        content: |
          By default, imported scenes are private to the user that uploaded them and scenes generated from public data sources are discoverable by all users.
          Scene permissions will eventually expand to include making imported scenes discoverable to all users or just users within an organization.
  - name: Images
    description: |
      Images are single or multi-band rasters that can be viewed and edited as a single unit but are always associated with a parent scene. They are sometimes synonymous with their parent scenes and other times just one of several images associated with their parent scenes. One common example of an image is a multispectral satellite image; another is a land classification raster.
    further-description:
      - title: Image permissions
        content: |
          Images respect the permissions applied to their parent scenes.
  - name: Uploads
    description: 'Uploads are datasets that a user or application has attempted to upload to Raster Foundry (successfully or unsuccessfully).'
    further-description:
      - title: Uploads permissions
        content: |
          All user uploads are private to that user.
  - name: Datasources
    description: |
      Datasources contain information common to all scenes associated with them, such as the number of bands to expect in images associated with that datasource. A datasource can be specific (e.g. a particular earth observation satellite) or generic (e.g. a 3-band sensor on a UAV). All scenes must have an associated datasource.

  - name: Tokens
    description: |
      Tokens are used to securely identify users and applications accessing the API.
  - name: Tools
    description: |
      Tools are algorithms that can be applied to projects manually or automatically.
      Tools can range from primitive statistical queries, to algebraic functions, to complex logic trees of operations happening in parallel. Tools can be constructed of other tools, custom-defined operations, or both. They can take any number of projects as inputs.
  - name: Users
    description: |
      Users and third party applications can be managed with the Users resource.
  - name: Organizations
    description: |
      Organizations are associations of users who share uniform access to permissions-protected resources.
  - name: Exports
    description: |
      Projects can be exported, but individual scenes and images cannot.
  - name: Shapes
    description: |
      Shapes are vectors that each user can create and manage. These shapes can then be used in various ways within the Raster Foundry platform.
  - name: Licenses
    description: |
      A license is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something. Users can add licenses to the data they create and share in Raster Foundry to communicate to others if and how that data can be used.
  - name: Teams
    description: |
      Teams represent groups of users within (and across) organizations. Each team belongs to one organization. A user can be a member of any number of teams.
  - name: Admin
    description: |
      Platforms, Organizations, and Teams can be used to manage users and visibility of projects, analyses, and scenes. Most of these functions will only be available to uses who are administrating groups.
